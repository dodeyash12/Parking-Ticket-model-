This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze and predict parking violations using a real-world dataset from Pennsylvania (PA). 
The goal is to improve traffic enforcement, urban planning, and resource allocation by predicting violation types based on spatial, temporal, and monetary factors and identifying geographical clusters of violations using density-based clustering algorithms.
The repository includes data preprocessing, model training, visualization, and an in-depth evaluation of classification and clustering results.

1. Project Objectives
Predict Parking Violations: Classify violations based on spatial (latitude/longitude), temporal (hour, day, month), and monetary (fine amount) features using Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifiers.
Identify Violation Clusters: Apply HDBSCAN clustering to find high-density violation zones and uncover patterns in parking behaviors.
Provide Actionable Insights: Use data visualizations and classification metrics to enhance enforcement strategies and parking policies.
